# Multiselect-JuxtaposeJS

Multiselect-Juxtapose is a fork of [JuxtaposeJS][1] allowing for multiple images to be used in the image slider at the same time.

#### Installation and API

The installation and API are exactly the same as on [JuxtaposeJS](https://github.com/peterwheeler/multiselect-juxtapose/blob/master/README.md).

Ensure that each image has an `data-label` and `id` attribute defined as these are linked to the display label and the label of the dropdown menu. If each image has a `data-credit` attribute defined, the slider will display a credit for each image.

####CSS

Dropdowns have been styled using [Materializecss][2]. You can customize how the rest of the slider looks by modifying the `juxtapose.css`.
